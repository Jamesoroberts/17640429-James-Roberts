		<p>Benjamin John Howard was born on 24 April 1987 in Richmond, south-west London, England, and moved near Totnes,
		Devon when he was about eight. He was raised by musical parents who exposed him to their favorite records from 
		singer-songwriter artists from the 1960s and 1970s at an early age, such as John Martyn, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell
		and Simon & Garfunkel, by whom he was strongly influenced. Howard began writing songs when he was eleven. In an
		interview with American Songwriter, he stated that when he was a kid he started playing guitar because he liked to put
		words together and make stuff up. "I was quite an imaginative little kid I guess. So your standard little love songs 
		turned into your standard adolescent love songs. I think you start getting your own take on things when you're a late teen.
		That's when everything changes". Besides playing the guitar, Howard also played other instruments as a kid. He easily
		picked up the drums and contrabass, but after some time he decided to focus on the guitar. After attending King Edward VI 
		Community College and Torquay Boys' Grammar School (which he left after a short time) he began studying Journalism at 
		University College Falmouth, Cornwall. Six months prior to completion of his course, Howard decided to focus on making 
		music full-time, making melodic rootsy folk music, with progressively darker lyrics. His reputation grew around Cornwall
		and Devon, and soon spread to other areas of the UK. After a month of sold-out dates across Europe and the UK Howard was 
		eventually asked to sign for Island Records.</p>

		<p>Before signing to a record label, Howard had already released some material. In 2008 he self-released his debut EP 
		Games in the Dark. His first major release was These Waters, an EP featuring six tracks, including "The Wolves". 
		In 2010, Ben Howard released the Old Pine EP, followed by a number of singles, such as "The Fear" and "Keep Your Head Up".
		Howard now had enough material to release an album, Every Kingdom, which would feature a number of his previous singles.
		One of the songs from this album, 'Promise' was used in the first episode of The 100. In 2010, he also started 
		supporting Angus & Julia Stone's concerts in Europe. He also joined them for one live performance of Yellow Brick Road in Paris.
		Howard signed to Island Records in 2011, due to the label's history of UK folk singers, including Nick Drake and John Martyn. 
		After singles "Old Pine" and "The Wolves" were released in 2011, Howard recorded his debut album entitled Every Kingdom,
		which was released on 3 October 2011. He was nominated for the 2012 Mercury Prize. Howard worked alongside India Bourne 
		and Chris Bond to make Every Kingdom, with Bourne playing cello, keyboards, ukulele, bass and contributing vocals and 
		percussion and Bond playing guitars, bass, double bass, drums, percussion, keyboards, accordion, contributing to vocals,
		and also producing the record. He also toured with Bourne and Bond on his 2012 Every Kingdom tour, with support from Willy Mason. 
		In 2012, Howard launched his music in America with Every Kingdom being released on 3 April 2012, and appearances at South
		by Southwest (SXSW) in Texas and a US tour confirmed. His song "Promise" was featured at the end of season 8, episode 
		12 of TV show House. In May 2012, Howard performed "The Wolves" on Later... with Jools Holland. He played at Pinkpop 
		in the Netherlands on 26 May and Radio 1's Big Weekend in Hackney on 24 June 2012. He also played at the 2012 Bonnaroo
		Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, the 2012 T in the Park music festival in Scotland, as well as Beach Break
		Live 2012 in South Wales, Bestival 2012 and Splendour in the Grass 2012. Howard also played a slot at the Austin City 
		Limits Music Festival in October 2012. In November 2012, Howard released The Burgh Island EP produced by Chris Bond,
		which featured four new tracks. Once again released to critical acclaim,[by whom?] the EP had a darker, more menacing
		tone than most of Howard's previous work, with Howard also playing electric guitar, rather than his traditional acoustic.
		The second track from the EP, "Oats in the Water", was featured in Internment, the 5th episode in Season 4 of AMC's The
		Walking Dead, in the 1st episode in season 3 of Fox's The Following, and in the release trailer for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>

		<p>In 2014, Howard headlined the inaugural Somersault Festival, based in North Devon, with other artists such as Jack Johnson. 
		On 5 August 2014, Howard's first single "End of the Affair" from his second album was played on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 
		and Danielle Perry's XFM show. On 18 August 2014 Howard announced the title of his second album, I Forget Where We Were
		on Zane Lowe's show on Radio 1 whilst releasing the title track from the record at the same time. On 26 October
		"I Forget Where We Were" became number 26 in the UK Official Albums Chart. On 6 April 2015, Howard announced a short
		string of tour dates in the US with English indie folk band Daughter as support. These dates were announced following
		a string of successful shows in Canada and the US.</P>

		<p>On April 4, 2018, it was announced that Howard's third album, titled Noonday Dream, will be released on June 1, 2018.
		A new single was also released, titled "A Boat To An Island On The Wall". The single debuted on Annie Mac's Radio 1 show
		with accompanying 2018 UK tour dates announced. A tracklist for the upcoming album was released on his website which includes
		the following: "Nica Libres At Dusk", "Towing The Line", "A Boat To An Island On The Wall", "What The Moon Does", 
		"Someone In The Doorway", "All Down The Mines (interlude)", "The Defeat", "A Boat To An Island, Part II / Agatha's Song", 
		"There's Your Man" and "Murmurations", along with bonus vinyl-only tracks "Bird On A Wing" and "Interlude".
		He played on Later Live with Jools Holland on BBC2 15.5.18. On September 13, 2018, Ben Howard released 'Another Friday
		Night/Heavy Summer (featuring Sylvan Esso)/Sister' a track of three different singles.</P>
